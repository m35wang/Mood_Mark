# Mood_Mark

As humans, emotions are an integral part of communicating to convey feelings and add character to our personalities. Expressing said emotions bridges the gap between our internal intentions and the external world. With Mood Mark, human emotions can be detected and communicated using layered stamp, expressing the complexity and depth of different feelings. To fulfill the project Mood Mark, a Braccio Robotic Arm is used to stamp artworks based on the userâ€™s emotion, either happiness or sadness.
